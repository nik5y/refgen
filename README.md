# refgen
Automation of reference generation with CiteThisForMe

Ideas: 

1. Can have JSON as input
2. The JSON can have separate fields for like referenceByDOI, referenceByName, etc, depending on the differences that various Journal searches entail. E.g. pretty sure that searching a name brings you to a search result page where usually you have to select the top answer.
3. Add an option to the program to generate a JSON template in case original one is lost or formatting broken
